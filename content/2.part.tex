\section{Abstract selection}

After reading the papers from the list I concluded that the next papers are relevant to my topic:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-Layer Collaborative In-Network Processing in Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks
    \item A Survey on the Encryption of Convergecast Traffic with In-Network Processing
    \item Secure and Trusted in-network Data Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks: a Survey
    \item Real-time forest fire detection with wireless sensor networks
    \item Curve Query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
    \item Corona: Energy-Efficient Multi-query Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
\end{itemize}

The papers that I chose not to use are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CCN-WSN - A lightweight, flexible Content-Centric Networking protocol for wireless sensor networks
    \item Using software-defined networking principles for wireless sensor networks
    \item Security support for in-network processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
    \item On the concept of distributed digital signal processing in wireless sensor networks
    \item Energy-Balanced Task Allocation for Collaborative Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks
    \item An Enhanced Stable Election Protocol (SEP) for Clustered Heterogeneous WSN
